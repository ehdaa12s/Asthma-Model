# Asthma-Model
completed a project focused on developing a machine learning model to predict asthma processes. We utilized various algorithms, including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, to ensure the highest accuracy and reliability in our predictions.

ðŸŽ¯ Key highlights:

Leveraged the power of Decision Trees and Random Forest for robust classification.
Applied Logistic Regression for understanding the underlying probabilities.
Incorporated Naive Bayes for handling large datasets with high dimensionality.
ðŸ™Œ A huge thank you to the incredible team that made this possible:
